## 1. Requirements:

- The system must have 2 types of users: Clients, Event Administrators (Sellers).

- Event Administrators are responsible for registering events and managing events created by them.

- Customers are users who access the system to buy event tickets.

- Each event admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email and password.

- Each customer's record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email and password.

- Event records include, at least: name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock), location, date.

- Selling Event Tickets: Events are selected, their quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Tickets are purchased using a credit card number (any number is accepted by the system). The quantity of ticket sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.

- Event Management: Event Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new events. For example, they can change the quantity in stock.

- Customers must be able to transfer ticket between accounts (Specific Functionality).

- Each Ticket from an Event Purchase generates a custom QR Code containing the ticket information. This QR Code is used to validate the ticket.
  (Specific Functionality)

- The system must provide accessibility requirements and provide good usability.

- The system must be responsive.

## 2. Project Description:

[**Tik.me**](https://tik-me-tmp.vercel.app/) is a web application that allows users to find and buy tickets for events, besides that users can exchange tickets between accounts. Event Administrators can create and manage their events.

The system will be developed using Next.js and MongoDB.
