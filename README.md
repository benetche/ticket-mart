## 1. Requirements:

- The system must have 3 types of users: Clients, Event Administrators (Sellers) and Super Admins.

- Super Admins are responsible for registering/managing super admins, event administrators, customers, and events. The application already comes with a super admin account admin with password admin.

- Event Administrators are responsible for registering events and managing events created by them.

- Customers are users who access the system to buy event tickets.

- The super admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email.

- Each event admin record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email, address, CPF/CNPJ, banking info and photo.

- Each customer's record includes, at least: name, id, phone, email, CPF, birth date and photo.

- Event records include, at least: name, id, photo, description, price, quantity (in stock), quantity sold, location, date, attractions and age limit.

- Selling Event Tickets: Events are selected, their quantity chosen, and are included in a cart. Tickets are purchased using a credit card number (any number is accepted by the system). The quantity of ticket sold is subtracted from the quantity in stock and added to the quantity sold. Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.

- Event Management: Event Administrators can create/update/read/delete (crud) new events. For example, they can change the stock quantity.

- Customers must be able to transfer ticket between accounts (Specific Functionality).

- The system must provide accessibility requirements and provide good usability.

- The system must be responsive.

## 2. Project Description:

**Tik.me** is a web application that allows users to find and buy tickets for events, besides that users can exchange tickets between accounts. Event Administrators can create and manage their events. Super Admins can create and manage other users and any events.

The system will be developed using Next.js and MongoDB.

To the moment the system is still in development and is not fully functional. What is available are mockups of the application made using Figma and three incipient mockup pages built with Next.js.

### 2.1 System Mockups:

The three main mockups made with Next.js are available at [tik-me-tmp.vercel.app](https://tik-me-tmp.vercel.app/). Source Code for them can be found at the root of the repository.

The remaining system mockups are available at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/e6l1Ek7bTZZzTFtO5qVqpu/Ticket-Mart)
